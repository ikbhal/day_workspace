https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com/ (I have no facebook page- ignore the fakes)
FAQ
Q.Where is this? 
A.This is in Far North Queensland Australia.
Q.Do you live in the wild?
A.I don't live in the wild but just go into the bush to make these projects. Also I camp out here occasionally.
Q.How did you learn all this?
A.Researching books and internet plus trial and error. I'm not indigenous and have no army training.
Q.What about dangerous animals in Australia?
A.The only really dangerous ones in my area are snakes. Care must be taken when walking about and lifting things from the ground.
Q.For the mud huts what stops the rain washing the mud walls away?
A.The roof.
Q.Why don't you talk in the videos?
A.When I watch how to videos I fast forward past the talking part to see the action part. So I leave it out of my videos in favor of pure demonstration.

It's a very clever decision on his part. No matter if you only speak Portugese or Swahili, if you watch this channel you will understand everything in it.﻿

he gained a mil in 3 months? Dam﻿

He does "talk" of sorts. He has sub-titles, in multiple languages, supported by credited translators. He also writes a blog and posts text about the videos. The reason he doesn't talk, isn't meta or anything other than he is demonstrating what he would like to see from others. "Just get on with it and show me how it's done." Too many times a 2 minute video is nine or ten minutes because the you-tuber is so chatty. He is showing us etiquette...﻿

Depends on the season and the size of the project. His clay house took over 160 days, so these are not simple videos that take fifteen minutes to produce. A lot of days go into them, so patience is a virtue. Not to mention things in his everyday life might get in the way.﻿

Thanks for all the great videos Primitive Tech. You are one of the small hand full of people who actually take the time and patience to do this stuff.  These days everyone is about quick and easy and everything being on their time but that is just not how the world works.﻿

we are missing you man @Primitive Technology, new videos coming anytime soon ?﻿

I just discovered this channel this evening when I was looking for 'pottery' videos. I am mesmerized by his approach; it is the epitome of patience. I found myself shaking my head in disbelief as he built the mud walls of the tiled hut. Just amazing! So happy to have found this! Thank you for sharing your hobby.﻿

It was hot embers from the fireplace. You could also start a fire on top of the mound, it doesn't really matter as long as the mound starts burning from the top down.Thanks.﻿

He doesn't make money off views because there are no ads in the videos. He hasn't made one penny off this channel﻿

Most likely because he makes a ton of money off pure views and there is no more point in donations.﻿

About Primitive Technology
Primitive technology is a hobby where you make things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. This is the strict rule. If you want a fire- use fire sticks, an axe- pick up a stone and shape it, a hut- build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without modern technology. If this hobby interests you then this blog might be what you are looking for.

Also It should be noted that I don’t live in the wild but just practice this as a hobby. I live in a modern house and eat modern food. I just like to see how people in ancient times built and made things. It is a good hobby that keeps you fit and doesn’t cost anything apart from time and effort.

IMPORTANT: This WordPress site, my Patreon page (https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881&u=2945881&ty=h) and my YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/c/PrimitiveTechnology) are my only online presence at this stage. I do not have a Facebook page and if you see any they are fake.
