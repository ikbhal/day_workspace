Based on Invention of principle.

What is my principle.

I am currently struggling with time managment issue.
I have problem of managing, work, life balance.
I have want to do things 

like go to prayers 5 times a day
Blog every day  at least once
Talk to new people for 5 minutes atleast
Help other may it be small work even less than 5 minutes
Learn new technologies
Read tech articles
Work on product portfolio

and so on..

But what happens is 
Due to mismanagment of time
I eithter do it more one task(reading, learing,work)
neglect other tasks
Which leads lots of problems
like not creating product portfolio
not going to prayers
no building nurturing relationships with kids, wife, parents, friends, neigbour

as i am not completings my goal 
i felt bad.

what i tried few times are
putting alarm
writing tasks
planning
reading motivation articles
even taking help from wife, mom to help me on track of my task to reach goal.

but things wont be same as expected.

why not create service or network of people who believe in helping others
like reminding for prayers, motivating others to complete their goal
planning task for others, preparing material from online
learn arabic words a day
