How to Start a Reminder Call Business

Service-based businesses often cost less to start than businesses that stock and sell products. In some cases, they can be less costly to run as well. If you are responsible and organized, with a pleasant speaking voice, a reminder service business may be a good fit for you. This business is also easy to launch on a budget, as you may use a phone line and computer you already own to get started. The bulk of your start-up expense may go to licensing and advertising.

1. Brainstorm the types of reminders you will provide. For example, you can provide appointment reminders as well as reminders for events, special occasions and even bills that are due. You may also offer wake-up calls.

2. Decide how you will provide reminders. Many services provide reminders by phone, but you can also offer email or mail reminders.
3. Set prices for your reminder services. Deciding how to price your services can be difficult, but calling established reminder services to request their prices may help. Once you have obtained prices from several companies, you can then use this range to price your services competitively.

4. Prepare a business plan for your reminder service. Include information about where you will make your reminder calls, such as from a home office or commercial space. Plan how many phone lines you will need and whether you will hire an employee or two to help you. Also include plans for advertising your business and eventually expanding it.

5. Set up an office. You will usually need a phone line, desk, computer, fax machine and basic office supplies to run this business. If you will hire an employee to make calls simultaneously, you will need a separate phone line or extension as well.

6. Build a business website for your reminder service and include information about the services you provide, how interested parties can contact you and how they can purchase and pay for your services. Add articles that include keywords related to reminder services to your website to make it easy for people to find your business through Internet searches. In addition, you may get more visitors to your website if you add your website address to all of your marketing materials.

7. Market your new reminder business. Place an ad in national newspapers as well as local publications. Create online ads and advertise through fliers you post on public bulletin boards. Sending direct mail advertisements to business owners can be effective for advertising a reminder service as well.
