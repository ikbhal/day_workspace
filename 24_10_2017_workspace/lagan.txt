hows things going
Are you enjoying work


tough to give, listen to guidance

guidance clarity, caring 	

hated to going to him, for help

made me feel like dont care
asshole boss: dont have clarity, dont have care

too nice, but not clarity:
fired, but not giving why you are fired
 dont want to hurt feelings

might be hard to hear: good clarity, good care
But you know it comes from  a good place

----
nurture relation, care people
give guidance immediately
guidance should be in person
 not email, not chat

deal with bad habits
be aware of bad habits

Help 
Convert a full website to PDF

With a business license you can make use of our easy-to-use website to PDF conversion page. With a few simple clicks you can choose which website to convert and we'll then create a PDF of the entire website for you. We use the conversion options (such as page size and orientation) that you select in our members area. As soon as we're done with the PDF we'll send you an email so you can download it.

Features

Convert a whole website to PDF in one go.
No need for you to be online - we notify once your PDF is ready.
Use many options to control the PDF layout such as page size, orientation and header & footer.
Apply watermarks or stamps on the PDFs.
Protect and encrypt the PDFs you create.
Usage

The screen below is the one that you will see in our members area unless you have upgraded to the advanced version.

convert entire website to pdf
You just execute the following steps.

Enter the URL of the website that you want to convert
Schedule the conversion, grab a coffee and wait for the result!
How the process works

After you enter your site and schedule the conversion, we will try to gather all the pages of your website.

If you have a sitemap

We will first always try to find your sitemap (what is a sitemap?) to do this. If you don't have a sitemap yet, we strongly advise you to create one because that's the most reliable way to ensure we take the right pages. You can create one online here if you don't have a sitemap yet or if you don't know how to do this.

Your XML sitemap needs to be listed in your robots.txt file or in the root of your domain, so if your site is http://www.example.com then your sitemap needs to be at http://www.example.com/sitemap.xml. You can find out more about sitemaps at sitemaps.org.

If you don't have a sitemap

If you don't have a sitemap or choose not to install one then our software will try to gather all the pages of your website by crawling through the website. This is done in a manner that other crawlers (e.g. search engines like Google, Bing etc) also use. Our software will try to do its best, but will not be able to crawl Javascript links nor will it always be able to identify duplicate pages correctly (e.g. when you use pages with query parameters).

Layout options for your PDF

The options that you have set and saved in the members area home page, are also the ones that we will use for the website to pdf conversion. So if you want all pages in A4 / portrait format, then you first set those options in the members area and save them and then start the website to PDF conversion process.

How many pages can I convert?

The website conversion process counts every webpage in your website as one conversion so if your website contains 500 pages then you will be able to do this process exactly ONCE with a Starter License, because that package allows 500 PDFs.

Limitations

In order to protect our systems and our other customers from servers being overused, we have the following default limitations. These limits can be lifted on request, but a surcharge will apply. Please inquire for a possible upgrade of your license.

You can submit a maximum of one website at a time
If you want to convert an entire website, then it must have a maximum of 500 webpages
When a website has no sitemap, we crawl a maximum of 10 levels deep and up to 2000 pages
Your PDFs are stored up to two days so please download your result before that

https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Migration.html

mix ecto.gen.migration add_todo_table
---
->I have already Created Phoenix app.
You can see now
-> created migration fil
I am trying to adding todo table 
--
lets check whether it created or not
--
it created now
Lets fill Elixir
---
I created migration now.
->Lets run it.
mix ecto.migrate
---
it ran now
---
lets check in the db.
we just now saw it created table
---
we can rollback migration too

mix ecto.rollback

outputs says it dropped table todos
now lets check it now

no table right now
---
okay i want the table now
so i am going to run again the migrate
lets see if it going to create table todos again or not
--

i already created , lets drop rollback, recreate it back
mix ecto.rollback
--
its not working
lets delete table from postgresql admin pgadmin
i deleted
now lets run migrate
mix ecto.migrate

done it created table
---

ecto insert row in table
---
todo add form
iex insert todo row in todos table

how to load phoenix app interactively
https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto/wiki/Ecto-Basics
iex -S mix

todo = %Todo
--

1)Lets create Ecto Schema

refernce:https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto/wiki/Ecto-Basics
file: lib/friends/person.ex
template:
defmodule Friends.Person do
  use Ecto.Schema

  schema "people" do
    field :first_name, :string
    field :last_name, :string
    field :age, :integer
  end
end

but i want differnet name for my Schema 
Lets say it Todo
my phoenix app name is Tod as well
i need to change above file name, content accordingly

---
lets check now in IEx session
iex -S mix

person = %Friends.Person{}
todo = %Todo.Todo{}
---
seems like one obstacle for now
---
1)Lets create simple Phoenix app only

run the command
mix phx.new todoapp
it creats folder you can see

---
Then configure your database in config/dev.exs and run:

    $ mix ecto.create
---
I already started postgresql server
i need to update credentials also
mine is 
username: postgres
password: password

done
---
we need to create a database with name todoapp_dev
i will create through pgadmin
---
i have old database todo_dev, confusing
i am going to delete it now
--
for our newly created databse todoapp_dev, we dont have table
--
no need to create database from pgadmin(postgres admin)
if you configure dev.exs file
and run mix ecto.create 
it will create database as well
---
1)lets delete database from pgadmin
2)and run the command
mix ecto.create
---
congrats
it created database
---
now lets run our app
---
mean while you can create others things like
1)migrations
2)Schema
---
our app started now
---
lets create schema
mix ecto.gen.migration add_todo_table
Now run the migration
mix ecto.migrate
---
check the database for table todos
---
lets create Todo Schema
--
lets try on IEx session for creating todo instance
and insert into db.
---
i will add changeset later
now lets see
---
$ iex -S mix
Compiling 1 file (.ex)
Generated todoapp app
Interactive Elixir (1.5.1) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)> todo = %Todoapp.Todo{title:"Create Todo Model", completed:false}
** (SyntaxError) iex:1: unexpected token: "olumn 23, codepoint U+001B)

iex(1)> todo =%Todoapp.todo{}
** (SyntaxError) iex:1: unexpected token: "olumn 1, codepoint U+001B)

i dont understand why it throwing error.
till now we success
---
trying to drop database
mix ecto.drop
dropped the database
if you open even pgadmin console, it wont drop it.
so close pgadmin, then drop with ecto.drop
---
so recreate database
mix ecto.create
run the migration
mix ecto.migrate
---
iex -S mix
t = %Todoapp.Todo{}
t = %{t | title: "Create todoap", completed: false}
---
again same issue
is it issue with completed
--
 todo = %Todoapp.Todo{title:"Create Todo app"}
** (SyntaxError) iex:1: unexpected token: "olumn 23, codepoint U+001B)

# The permalink can come preloaded on the post struct
