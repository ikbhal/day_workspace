Are you enjoying work


tough to give, listen to guidance

guidance clarity, caring 	

hated to going to him, for help

made me feel like dont care
asshole boss: dont have clarity, dont have care

too nice, but not clarity:
fired, but not giving why you are fired
 dont want to hurt feelings

might be hard to hear: good clarity, good care
But you know it comes from  a good place

nurture relation, care people
give guidance immediately
guidance should be in person
 not email, not chat

Convert a full website to PDF

With a business license you can make use of our easy-to-use website to PDF conversion page. With a few simple clicks you can choose which website to convert and we'll then create a PDF of the entire website for you. We use the conversion options (such as page size and orientation) that you select in our members area. As soon as we're done with the PDF we'll send you an email so you can download it.

Features

Convert a whole website to PDF in one go.
No need for you to be online - we notify once your PDF is ready.
Use many options to control the PDF layout such as page size, orientation and header & footer.
Apply watermarks or stamps on the PDFs.
Protect and encrypt the PDFs you create.
Usage

The screen below is the one that you will see in our members area unless you have upgraded to the advanced version.

convert entire website to pdf
You just execute the following steps.

Enter the URL of the website that you want to convert
Schedule the conversion, grab a coffee and wait for the result!
How the process works

After you enter your site and schedule the conversion, we will try to gather all the pages of your website.

If you have a sitemap

We will first always try to find your sitemap (what is a sitemap?) to do this. If you don't have a sitemap yet, we strongly advise you to create one because that's the most reliable way to ensure we take the right pages. You can create one online here if you don't have a sitemap yet or if you don't know how to do this.

Your XML sitemap needs to be listed in your robots.txt file or in the root of your domain, so if your site is http://www.example.com then your sitemap needs to be at http://www.example.com/sitemap.xml. You can find out more about sitemaps at sitemaps.org.

If you don't have a sitemap

If you don't have a sitemap or choose not to install one then our software will try to gather all the pages of your website by crawling through the website. This is done in a manner that other crawlers (e.g. search engines like Google, Bing etc) also use. Our software will try to do its best, but will not be able to crawl Javascript links nor will it always be able to identify duplicate pages correctly (e.g. when you use pages with query parameters).

Layout options for your PDF

The options that you have set and saved in the members area home page, are also the ones that we will use for the website to pdf conversion. So if you want all pages in A4 / portrait format, then you first set those options in the members area and save them and then start the website to PDF conversion process.

How many pages can I convert?

The website conversion process counts every webpage in your website as one conversion so if your website contains 500 pages then you will be able to do this process exactly ONCE with a Starter License, because that package allows 500 PDFs.

Limitations

In order to protect our systems and our other customers from servers being overused, we have the following default limitations. These limits can be lifted on request, but a surcharge will apply. Please inquire for a possible upgrade of your license.

You can submit a maximum of one website at a time
If you want to convert an entire website, then it must have a maximum of 500 webpages
When a website has no sitemap, we crawl a maximum of 10 levels deep and up to 2000 pages
Your PDFs are stored up to two days so please download your result before that

in order to inject the value of number variable
unquote has to be used inside quoted rep

iex> number = 13
iex>Macro.to_string(quote do: 11 + unquote(number))
"11+13"
