Training Course: Day Zero

Have you ever fancied dipping your toes into the Clojure waters and exploring functional programming? If so, then this is the course for you. We’ll start from the very beginning, and will help you choose and set up the Clojure development environment that suits you before gently strolling up the Clojure foothills together.
This is a one-day course, designed for developers who have little or no exposure to Clojure or functional programming. It starts from the very beginning explaining the fundamentals of Clojure, helping developers to build up a basic proficiency in the language via the use of mentoring and immersive exercises.
As a programming language, Clojure is a compact language which is easy to learn. We’ll create a simple project and teach you all the basics: data, functions, sequences, namespaces and the bits of the JVM you need to know.

We had a range of different operating systems and IDEs to contend with. There were no users of Arch Linux on this course - which is what we use at JUXT - instead, we had some Macs and a Windows environment in play. We were able to get moving in Windows by installing Git Bash and from there boot-clj, which is the build system we use for Edge.

Edge

From "Datum edge". Also represents the 'edge' of our current thinking on the baseline architecture of Clojure projects. It contains architectural patterns for the rapid construction of robust and flexible systems.

Features

Edge is a simple project demonstrating the following:

A boot-driven Clojure/ClojureScript dev and prod environment

cd edge
boot dev
Browse to localhost:3000

To fire up a REPL, open a new session and

cd edge
boot repl
Make changes to the Clojure code and reset the system

REPL-y 0.3.7, nREPL 0.2.12
Clojure 1.8.0

              (find-doc "part-of-name-here")
Find by Name: (find-name "part-of-name-here")
      Source: (source function-name-here)
     Javadoc: (javadoc java-object-or-class-here)
    Examples from clojuredocs.org: [clojuredocs or cdoc]
              (user/clojuredocs name-here)
              (user/clojuredocs "ns-here" "name-here")

Use of schema.core/defrecord to validate your system's integrity on every reset
Run all your tests with (test-all)
bidi & yada for serving web resources and APIs
ClojureScript REPL

An optional ClojureScript REPL is available. Create a new REPL by connecting to localhost on port 5600. You can do this with boot, lein, CIDER or with another IDE. Once the REPL has started, launch the CLJS repl with the following:

user> (cljs-repl)
This should connect with your browser and you can then interactively work with cljs.

Libraries

aero
aleph
bidi
hiccup
selmer
yada
Editor integration

Emacs / CIDER.el integration

These instructions are for use with CIDER 0.15 (London). If your Emacs is using a previous version, you should upgrade now.

From Emacs, use M-x cider-jack-in

Generic CIDER-nrepl integration

See Boot's instructions on CIDER repl, and run boot with boot cider dev

Deployment

A systemd wrapper script is provided in the top level directory. It takes a parameter which determines the Aero profile to use. In this way you can have multiple systemd units with different profiles on the same machine, even under the same username.

What is Namespaces?
A namespace is used to define 
logical boundary between modules defined in clojure. 
---
namespace is analogous to java package
each clojure library belongs to namespace
(require quoted-namespace-symbol)

(ns clojure.examples.hello
	(:gen-class))
(require 'clojure.java.io')
(defn Example []
	(.exists (file "Example.txt")))
(Example)

---
Delimiters
statements can be split or  delimited by 
using  either the curved or square bracket braces

(ns clojure.examples.hello
	(:gen-class))
(defn Example []
	(print [+ 1 2 3]))
(Example)
---
Whitespaces can be used in Clojure to split
differnet components of a statement for better clarity.
This can be done with assistance of the comm(,)
operator.
For example, the folliwng two statments are equivalent
and the output of both statments wil be 15
(+ 1 2 3 4 5)
(+ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
---
map
{:a 1, :b 2, :c 3}
{:a 1 :b 2 :c 3}
---
symbol are equivalent to identifiers in other programming  language. But unlike other programming languages, the compiler ses the symbols as actual string values. As a symbol is a avlue, a symbol can be 
stored in a collection, passed as an argument to a function, etc., just like any other object.

A symbole can only contain alphanumeric charactesr and 
`* + ! /. : - > ?`  but must not begin with a numeral or colon

clojure project structure
since clojure code runs on java virtual macine,
most of the project structure within clojure is
similar to what you would fine in a java project

	:dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]])

----
REPL (read-eval-print loop) is a tool for experimenting with Clojure code. It allows you to interact with running program and quicly try out of if things work out as they should. It does this by presenting you with a prompt where you can enter the code. t then read your input, evaluates it, prints the result and loops, presenting you with a prompt again.

This process enables a quick feedback cycle that isnt possible in most other languages.

Starting a REPL session.
a REPL session can be started in Leiningen by typing the following command in the command line.
lein repl

	(:gen-class))

;; This program displays Hello World
(defn Example []
	;; The below code declares a integer variable
	(def x 1)

	;; The below code declares a float variable
	(def y 1.25)

	;; The below code declares a string variable

variables
are defined by the 'def' keyworld. Its a bit different wherein the concept of variables has more to do with bindings. In Clojure, a value is bound to a variable. One key things to note in clojure is that variable are immutable, which means that in order for the value of the variable to change, it needs to be destroyed and recreated again.

syntax
(def var-name var-value)

---
(ns clojure.examples.hello
	(:gen-class))

;; This program displays Hello World
(defn Example []
	;; The below code declares a integer variable
	(def x 1)

	;; The below code declares a float variable
	(def y 1)

	;; The below code declarea a string variable
	(def str1 "Helo")

	;; The below code declares a boolean variable
	(def status true))

(Example)
----
Naming variables 
The name of a variable can be compose fo letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or a underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because Clojure, just like Java is case-sensitive programming language.

Example
Following are some examples of variable naming in Clojure.
(ns clojure.examples.hello
	(:gen-class))

;; This program displays Hello World
(defn Example []
	;; The below code declares a Boolean variable with name of status
	(def status strue)

	;; The below code declares a Boolean variable with the name of status
	(def STATU false)

	;; The below code declares a variable with an underscore character
	(def _num1 2))

Operator precedence
no need to worry about operator precedence.
This is one of the benefits of S-Expresions and prefix notation. All functions evaluate left to right and inside out. The operators in Clojure are just functions, and everything is fully parenthesized.
---
loops
while statement
Doseq statement (for each) iterate over sequence
Dotimes statement , execute a statement x number of times
Loop statement
The loop special form is not like a for loop. The usage of loop is the same as the let binding. However, loop sets as recursion point.

Example
(ns clojure.examples.hello

		10 (println "x is 10")
		(println "x is neither 5 or 10")))

(Example)
---
output
x is 5

---
Clojure offers another evaluation statement called the 'cond' statement. This statement takes a set of test/expression pairs. It evaluates each ttest one at a time. If a test retruns logical true, 'Cond' evalutes and returns the value of the corresponding expression and doesnt evaluate any of other tests or expression. 'cond' returns nil.

Syntax
cond
(expression evaluation1) statement #1
(expression evaluation2) statment #2
(expression evaluetion N) statement #n
:else statement #default

Example
(ns clojure.examples.hello
	(:gen-calss))

(defn Example []
	(def x 5)
	(cond
		(= x 5) (println "x is 5")
		(= x 10) (println "x is 10")
		:else (println "x is not defined")))

(Example)
---
Output
x is 5
---
Functions

---
(defn Example []
	(def x 1)
	(def y 1.25)
	(println x)
	(println y))
(Example)
--
anonymous function is function which has no nmae associted with it.
(defn Example []
	((fn [x] (* 2 x)) 2))
(Example)
---
output
4

---
number of parameters is function raity.
(defn demo [] (* 2 2))
(defn demo[x] (* 2 x))
(defn demo [x y] (* 2 x y))

o-arity, 1-arity, 2-arity
---
variadic funtions are functions that take everytihng 
varying number of argumetns. Function can also specify the & ampersand symbol to take in an arbitary number of arguments

(defn demo
	[message & others]
	(str message (clojure.string/join "" others)))

& symbol next to the argument others, which means that it can take an arbitrary number of argumetns.

(demo "Hello" "This" "is" " the" "message")
output
"HelloThis is the message"
---
High-order function (HOFs) are functions that take other functions as argumetns. HOFs are an important functional programming technique and are quite commonly used in Clojure. One example of an HOF is a function taht takes a function and  ac ollection and retuns a collection of elemtns that satisfy a conditon(a predicate)
In clojure, this function is called clojure.core/filter

example
(filter even?(ragne 0 10))
output
(0 2 4 6 8)

--
Numbers
derived from java classes
(def x 5)
(println (type x))
Java.lang.long

Number tests
zero? ;; returns true if number is zero or else false
pos? ;; returns >0
neg? ;; returns <0
even? ;; return if even numbef
odd?
number? ;; if number
integer? ;; if integer
float? ;; if float
---

tail recursion, major feature of functional languages
recur special form is the one that implements tail recursion.
recur must be called in the tail positon.

(defn Example []
	(loop [i 0]
		(when (< i 5)
		(println i)
		(recur (inc i)))))
(Example)
--
output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

---
File/IO
reading

clojurel.core.slup -> to read entier file to string

(def string1 (slurp "Example.txt"))
(println string1)
---

clojure.java.io/reader
createa a reader buffer, which is used to read each line of the file
(defn Eample [])
	(with-open [rdr (clojure.java.io/reader "Example.txt")])
	(reduce conj [] (line-seq rdr)))

output:
line: Example1
line: Example2
---
(spit "Example.txt"
	"This is a string")
---
as write, write content, cllose files

--
writing to files one line at  a time
(defn Example []
	(with-open [w (clojure.java.io/writer "Example.txt" :append true)]
		(.write w (str "hello" "world"))))

(Example)

software transactional memory steym (STM), exposed through dosync, ref, set, alter, etc.
Supports sharing changing state between threads in a synchronous and coordinated manner. 

The agent system supports sharing changing state between threads in an asynchronous and independent mannger.

The atoms system supports sharing changing state between threads in a synchronous and independent manner.

The dynamic var system, exposed through def, binding, etc. suports isolating changing state within threads.

In clojure there are no locks, but Indirect reference to immutable persistent data structures.

There are three types of reference in Clojure.

Vars - Changess are isolated in threads.
Refs - changes are synronized and coordinated between threads.
Agents - Involves asynchronous indepedent changes between threads.


Transactions.
Concurrency in Clojure is based on transactions. 
References can only be changed within a transaction.

Clojure script

ClojureScript is a robust, practical, and fast programming language with a set of useful features that together form a simple, coherent, and powerfool tool

ClojureScript is a compiler for Clojure that targets JavaScript. It emits JavaScript code which is compatible with the advanced compilation mode of Google Closure optiming compiler.
---
Clojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming langue supporting interactive development. Clojure is functional programming language featureing a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. As a dialet of Lisp, it has a code-as-data phislosophy and powerful macro system.

md src\hello_world & type nul >>core.cljs & move core.cljs src\hello_world

(ns hello-world.core)

(enable-console-print!)
(println "Hello world!")

First we declare our namespace. Every ClojureScript file must declare a namespace and this namespace must match a path on disk. We then enable direct printing to the commonly available javascript console object and print the famous message.

In order to comile this we need a simple build script.
ClojureScript is just a Clojure librarary and can be easily scripted in a few lines of Clojure.
Create a file called build.clj next to the src directory and the cljs.jar file. Note the name of the file does not matter. In this tutorial we'll always make our compiler helper scripts at the root of the project directory.

Add the followingClojure code
(require 'cljs.build.api)
(cljs.build.api/build "src"  {:output-to "out/main.js"})

we require the cljs.build.api namespace. WE then invoke the standard function for building some Clojure Script source

This doesn't look like any web handler you'd create by wrapping Ring middleware together. It's as much a declarative description of the handler as an implementation of one.

With a declarative description we can know a lot about the service without running it, or knowing what the functions do. We know what methods it has (GET). We know what parameters are needed in the query string. We know what media types and languages are available. We even know what authentication scheme is in place, and what roles a user needs to access the resource.

A huge advantage of this declarative approach is that handlers can be produced with data, and data can be generated on an industrial scale. This allows us to transition, finally, the development burden of writing HTTP services from a craft to an industry. We shall elaborate this point in a future post, but first, let's focus on how yada works.

One Ring (handler) to rule them all

Essentially, yada is a Clojure function that takes a declarative description (like the one above) and returns a Ring handler function. That's it!



Due to yada's design, there is now just one Ring handler to forge (and we've already done the forging). Every developer using yada exploits the benefits of a single, expertly designed, Ring handler. What's more, as this handler improves these improvements are inherited by existing applications, often without requiring any developer intervention.

So what features are contained within this handler?

Parameter validation
Content negotiation (media-types, charsets, encodings and languages)
Conditional requests
Method semantics
Status codes
Response body coercion
Pluggable methods and media-types
Authentication (basic, session, OAuth2, custom)
Authorization (role-based, custom)
Security headers
Swagger
Optional async
Server sent events
bidi integration
Multipart request bodies
Asynchronous uploads
Schema validation (with coercion) of resource models
Dynamic sub-resources
Modifiable interceptor chains
Test helpers
Some of these are
